| `Mod offline`                                            | If enabled, M³ will not attempt to connect to JW.org or your congregation server. This is useful for when you have a poor internet connection and want to save bandwidth.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| `Preferințe de temă`                                     | Select the theme you prefer.

| `Rezoluția maximă pentru materiale video`                                       | Videos downloaded from JW.org will be downloaded at this resolution, or the next available lower resolution. Useful for limited or low-bandwidth situations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| `Activați subtitrările pentru materialele video`                                | Enable this option if you want to fetch subtitles for videos, whenever available. Subtitles will be shown by default, but can be toggled on/off while presenting. The vertical position of the subtitles can be changed by clicking the `subtitles` icon inside the video preview.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| `Convertiți media în format MP4`                                                | This will automatically convert all picture and audio files into MP4 format, for use with Zoom's [native MP4 sharing feature](assets/img/other/zoom-mp4-share.png) during fully remote congregation Zoom meetings. This includes all pictures and media files downloaded from JW.org, as well as additional media files added by the user or the VO. <br><br> ***Note:** This option is best suited for **remote-only** congregation Zoom meetings. If conducting either **hybrid** or **regular** congregation meetings, look into using [Media Presentation mode]({{page.lang}}/#present-media) by activating the `Present media on an external monitor or in a separate window` option instead, and disable this option.*                                           |
| `Păstrați fișierele media originale după conversie`                             | If this setting is enabled, picture and audio files will be kept in the media folder after being converted to MP4 format, rather than deleted. This will result in a slightly more cluttered media folder, and generally does not need to be enabled if sharing media through Zoom MP4 sharing. (See `Convert media to MP4 format` above.) <br><br> ***Note:** Only visible if `Convert media to MP4 format` is also enabled.*                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| `Prezintă materialele media pe un monitor extern sau într-o fereastră separată` | This setting will allow you to use M³ to present pictures, videos and audio files during **hybrid** or **in-person** congregation meetings. The media playback management screen can then be accessed by clicking the ▶️ (play) button on the main screen of M³. <br><br> The media presentation screen will automatically use an external monitor if present; if not, the media will be displayed in a separate, resizable window. <br><br> ***Note:** This option is best suited for either **hybrid** or **regular** congregation meetings. <br><br> If conducting **remote-only** congregation Zoom meetings, look into activating the `Convert media to MP4 format` option and sharing the media with Zoom's native MP4 sharing instead.* |
| `Imagine de fundal pentru modul de prezentare media`                            | By default, M³ will attempt to fetch the current year's text in the language selected previously, in order to display it on a black background when in [Media Presentation mode]({{page.lang}}/#present-media) and no other media is being played. If the automatic yeartext retrieval fails for some reason, or if you wish to display a different background image, you can either use the 'Browse' button to select a custom picture, or the 'Refresh' button to try fetching the yeartext automatically again. <br><br> ***Note:** If [Congregation sync]({{page.lang}}/#congregation-sync) is enabled, selecting a custom background image will synchronize it for all congregation sync users automatically.*                                                    |
| `Ascundeți fereastra media după redarea materialului`                           | If enabled, the media window will be hidden immediately after each media file has finished playing. <br><br> ***Note:** This setting is especially useful for sign-language meetings.*                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| `Redați automat primul material media`                                          | If enabled, the first media item in the media list will automatically start playing a configurable number of minutes before the meeting is supposed to start.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| `Enable keyboard shortcuts during media playback`                               | This setting allows you to set custom key combinations to play and stop media. This is useful in combination with a USB remote control, for example.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| `Create playlists for use with VLC`                                             | Enable this if you want to generate playlists for every meeting automatically, which can then be loaded in VLC, if you are using that app to display media instead of [Media Presentation mode]({{page.lang}}/#present-media).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| `Exclude all media from the th brochure`                                        | If enabled, this will prevent media from the *Apply Yourself* brochure from being included at every midweek meeting.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| `Exclude Enjoy Life Forever images outside the Congregation Bible Study`        | If enabled, this will prevent images from the *Live Forever* book (*lff*) from being included, for example for student assignments during the midweek meeting.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| `Includeți media tipărită atunci când este disponibil`                          | If enabled, renderings of the printed editions of publications will be included when available. This could be useful for some tables or groups of images that are clearer in printed form.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| `Următoarea vizită planificată a supraveghetorului de circumscripție` | When you select a date for the next planned visit of the circuit overseer, M³ will automatically set the midweek meeting day for that week to Tuesday, skip the Congregation Bible Study media, as well as skip the concluding Kingdom songs for both meetings. <br><br> ***Note:** When using a congregation server, make sure to enforce this setting so that all connected brothers have the same circuit overseer visit date configured.* |
| `Activați butonul pentru a reda muzica de fundal`                     | Enable a button on the main screen which will play Kingdom songs from the *sjjm* series, in random order. This is useful, for example, to play songs before and after meetings at the Kingdom Hall as background music. To the right of this option is a button to download all available Kingdom songs, which could be useful to prevent buffering delays.                                                                                               |
| `Volumul redării muzicii de fundal`                                   | Sets the volume at which the background music will play.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| `Redați automat muzica de fundal înainte de întruniri`                | If enabled, background music will automatically start playing at app startup when it's a meeting day and the meeting is starting in less than an hour.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| `Opriți automat redarea muzicii de fundal`                            | If `Enable button to play background music` is active, then this setting will allow you to specify a delay after which background music should be automatically stopped. This can be either a set number of minutes, or a predetermined number of seconds before the start of the meeting (in the case where the background music was started before a meeting).                                                                                          |
