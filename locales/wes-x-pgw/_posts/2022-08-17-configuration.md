| `Turn on mode wey de work well with OBS Studio`     | If you on-am, we go connect for OBS Studio and change the scenes on our own. E go happen automatically before you show pictures and after you close-am. <br><br> *If enabling this setting, make sure that OBS Studio is configured to use the `obs-websocket` plugin, which is what will enable M³ to communicate with OBS Studio. <br><br> Also, configure all needed scenes for media sharing and stage display in OBS. At the very least, you'll need a scene with a `Window Capture` (recommended) or `Display Capture` configured to capture the M³ media presentation window, or the screen on which the media will be presented. <br><br> You'll also need to configure all desired stage view scenes, for example: a shot of the lecturn, a wide shot of the stage, etc.* |

| `OBS Studio scene for show Zoom people`             | An optional scene to quickly and efficiently manage the display of Zoom participants during hybrid meetings. <br><br> When this scene is configured, the behavior of the [Media Presentation mode]({{page.lang}}/#present-media) changes somewhat.
