At the very least, you'll need a scene with a `Window Capture` (recommended) or `Display Capture` configured to capture the M³ media presentation window, or the screen on which the media will be presented. <br><br> You'll also need to configure all desired stage view scenes, for example: a shot of the lecturn, a wide shot of the stage, etc.* |

| `Максимальна роздільна здатність для відео`                            | Videos downloaded from JW.org will be downloaded at this resolution, or the next available lower resolution. Useful for limited or low-bandwidth situations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| `Конвертувати медіафайли в MP4 формат`                                 | This will automatically convert all picture and audio files into MP4 format, for use with Zoom's [native MP4 sharing feature](assets/img/other/zoom-mp4-share.png) during fully remote congregation Zoom meetings. This includes all pictures and media files downloaded from JW.org, as well as additional media files added by the user or the VO. <br><br> ***Note:** This option is best suited for **remote-only** congregation Zoom meetings. If conducting either **hybrid** or **regular** congregation meetings, look into using [Media Presentation mode]({{page.lang}}/#present-media) by activating the `Present media on an external monitor or in a separate window` option instead, and disable this option.*     |
| `Зберегти оригінальні медіафайли після перетворення`                   | If this setting is enabled, picture and audio files will be kept in the media folder after converting them to MP4 format, rather than being deleted. This will result in a slightly more cluttered media folder, and generally does not need to be enabled if sharing media through Zoom MP4 sharing. (`See Convert media to MP4 format` above.) <br><br> ***Note:** Only visible if `Convert media to MP4 format` is also enabled.*                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| `Відтворювати медіафайли на зовнішньому моніторі або в окремому вікні` | This setting will allow you to use M³ to present pictures, videos and audio files during **hybrid** or **in-person** congregation meetings. can then be accessed by clicking the ▶️ (play) button on the main screen of M³. <br><br> The media presentation screen will automatically use an external monitor if present; if not, the media will be displayed in a separate, resizable window. <br><br> ***Note:** This option is best suited for either **hybrid** or **regular** congregation meetings. <br><br> If conducting **remote-only** congregation Zoom meetings, look into activating the `Convert media to MP4 format` option and sharing the media with Zoom's native MP4 sharing instead. |
| `Фонове зображення для режиму презентації медіафайлів`                 | By default, M³ will attempt to fetch the current year's text in the language selected previously, in order to display it on a black background when in [Media Presentation mode]({{page.lang}}/#present-media) and no other media is being played. If the automatic yeartext retrieval fails for some reason, or if you wish to display a different background image, you can either use the 'Browse' button to select a custom picture, or the 'Refresh' button to try fetching the yeartext automatically again. <br><br> ***Note:** If [Congregation sync]({{page.lang}}/#congregation-sync) is enabled, selecting a custom background image will synchronize it for all congregation sync users automatically.*              |
| `Create playlists for use with VLC`                                    | Enable this if you want to generate playlists for every meeting automatically, which can then be loaded in VLC, if you are using that app to display media instead of [Media Presentation mode]({{page.lang}}/#present-media).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| `Exclude all media from the th brochure`                               | If enabled, this will prevent media from the *Apply Yourself* brochure from being included at every midweek meeting.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| `Exclude images from the lff book outside congregation bible study`    | If enabled, this will prevent images from the *Live Forever* book (_lff_) from being included, for example for student assignments during the midweek meeting.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

| `Увімкнути кнопку, щоб відтворювати пісні Царства у випадковому порядку` | Enable a button on the main screen which will play Kingdom songs from the *sjjm* series, in random order. This is useful, for example, to play songs before and after meetings at the Kingdom Hall as background music.                                                                                                                                                  |
| `Гучність відтворення пісні`                                             | Sets the volume at which the background music will play.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| `Автоматично зупиняти відтворення пісень`                                | If `Enable button to play Kingdom songs on shuffle` is active, then this setting will allow you to specify a delay after which background music should be automatically stopped. This can be either a set number of minutes, or a predetermined number of seconds before the start of the meeting (in the case where the background music was started before a meeting). |
