All media will be downloaded from JW.org in this language.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| `Idioma alternativo para multimédias`                                    | This language is used whenever the primary media language is not available. <br><br> For example, if you select Irish as your media language and English as your fallback, whenever a publication or video is not available in Irish, it will be fetched in English.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| `Resolução dos vídeos`                                                   | Videos downloaded from JW.org will be downloaded at this resolution, or the next available lower resolution. Useful for limited or low-bandwidth situations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| `Ativar legendas dos vídeos`                                             | Enable this option if you want to fetch subtitles for videos, whenever available. Subtitles will be shown by default, but can be toggled on/off while presenting.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| `Converter multimédias para MP4`                                         | This will automatically convert all picture and audio files into MP4 format, for use with Zoom's [native MP4 sharing feature](assets/img/other/zoom-mp4-share.png) during fully remote congregation Zoom meetings. This includes all pictures and media files downloaded from JW.org, as well as additional media files added by the user or the VO. <br><br> ***Note:** This option is best suited for **remote-only** congregation Zoom meetings. If conducting either **hybrid** or **regular** congregation meetings, look into using [Media Presentation mode]({{page.lang}}/#present-media) by activating the `Present media on an external monitor or in a separate window` option instead, and disable this option.*      |
| `Manter os ficheiros de multimédia originais após a conversão`           | If this setting is enabled, picture and audio files will be kept in the media folder after converting them to MP4 format, rather than being deleted. This will result in a slightly more cluttered media folder, and generally does not need to be enabled if sharing media through Zoom MP4 sharing. (`See Convert media to MP4 format` above.) <br><br> ***Note:** Only visible if `Convert media to MP4 format` is also enabled.*                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| `Exibir as multimédias num ecrã secundário`                              | This setting will allow you to use M³ to present pictures, videos and audio files during **hybrid** or **in-person** congregation meetings. can then be accessed by clicking the ▶️ (play) button on the main screen of M³. <br><br> The media presentation screen will automatically use an external monitor if present; if not, the media will be displayed in a separate, resizable window. <br><br> ***Note:** This option is best suited for either **hybrid** or **regular** congregation meetings. <br><br> If conducting **remote-only** congregation Zoom meetings, look into activating the `Convert media to MP4 format` option and sharing the media with Zoom's native MP4 sharing instead.* |
| `Imagem de fundo da tela secundária`                                     | By default, M³ will attempt to fetch the current year's text in the language selected previously, in order to display it on a black background when in [Media Presentation mode]({{page.lang}}/#present-media) and no other media is being played. If the automatic yeartext retrieval fails for some reason, or if you wish to display a different background image, you can either use the 'Browse' button to select a custom picture, or the 'Refresh' button to try fetching the yeartext automatically again. <br><br> ***Note:** If [Congregation sync]({{page.lang}}/#congregation-sync) is enabled, selecting a custom background image will synchronize it for all congregation sync users automatically.*               |
| `Ocultar a tela secundária após a reprodução de multimédia`              | If enabled, the media window will be hidden immediately after each media file has finished playing. <br><br> ***Note:** This setting is especially useful for sign-language meetings.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| `Enable keyboard shortcuts during media playback`                        | This setting allows you to set custom key combinations to play and stop media. This is useful in combination with a USB remote control, for example.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| `Create playlists for use with VLC`                                      | Enable this if you want to generate playlists for every meeting automatically, which can then be loaded in VLC, if you are using that app to display media instead of [Media Presentation mode]({{page.lang}}/#present-media).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| `Exclude all media from the th brochure`                                 | If enabled, this will prevent media from the *Apply Yourself* brochure from being included at every midweek meeting.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| `Exclude Enjoy Life Forever images outside the Congregation Bible Study` | If enabled, this will prevent images from the *Live Forever* book (*lff*) from being included, for example for student assignments during the midweek meeting.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| `Incluir multimédia impressa quando disponível`                          | If enabled, renderings of the printed editions of publications will be included when available. This could be useful for some tables or groups of images that are clearer in printed form.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

This is useful for theocratic schools, for example.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| `Reunião de meio de semana`                               | Indicate the usual day and time for the midweek meeting; used for folder naming and automatic background music fade-out (see below).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| `Reunião de fim de semana`                                | Indicate the usual day and time for the weekend meeting.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| `Habilitar botão para reproduzir cânticos aleatoriamente` | Enable a button on the main screen which will play Kingdom songs from the *sjjm* series, in random order. This is useful, for example, to play songs before and after meetings at the Kingdom Hall as background music. To the right of this option is a button to download all available Kingdom songs, which could be useful to prevent buffering delays.              |
| `Volume de reprodução dos cânticos`                       | Sets the volume at which the background music will play.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| `Parar de reproduzir os cânticos`                         | If `Enable button to play Kingdom songs on shuffle` is active, then this setting will allow you to specify a delay after which background music should be automatically stopped. This can be either a set number of minutes, or a predetermined number of seconds before the start of the meeting (in the case where the background music was started before a meeting). |
