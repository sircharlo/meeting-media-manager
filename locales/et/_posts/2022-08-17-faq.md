### Kas see rakendus sõltub väljaannete ja koosolekute meedia allalaadimiseks välistest saitidest, allikatest või "kuraatoritest"?

**No.** The app behaves similarly to JW Library. It downloads publications and media directly from the official JW.org website and its content delivery network. At runtime, the app automatically determines what needs to be downloaded, such as media files and publications. The source code is available for all to examine and verify this.

### Kas see rakendus rikub JW.org-i kasutustingimusi?

**No.** The JW.org [Terms of Use](https://www.jw.org/finder?docid=1011511&prefer=content) actually explicitly allow the kind of usage that we are making. Here is the relevant excerpt from those terms (emphasis mine):

> Te ei tohi:
> 
> Create for distribution purposes, any software applications, tools, or techniques that are specifically made to collect, copy, download, extract, harvest, or scrape data, HTML, images, or text from this site. (This does **not** prohibit the distribution of free, non-commercial applications designed to download electronic files such as EPUB, PDF, MP3, and MP4 files from public areas of this site.)
