> A Meeting Media Manager for meetings of Jehovah's Witnesses.

## What is M³?

**Meeting Media Manager**, or **M³** for short, is an app for Windows, macOS and Linux, that automatically downloads pictures and videos that will be considered during congregation meetings of Jehovah's Witnesses, in any language found on JW.org. It features recurring and custom media management, as well as an optional sync feature for members of the same congregation, as well as support for multiple congregations and/or groups using the same computer account.

<sup>Note: M³ used to be known as JWMMF (JW Meeting Media Fetcher), but was renamed in May 2022.</sup>

## What can M³ do?

M³ allows you to easily and automatically download, synchronize, share and present all meeting media.
For **hybrid** or **in-person** congregation meetings, the integrated media presentation mode has all the features needed to simplify the task of sharing media with the congregation, including:

- media thumbnails
- easy-to-use pause/play/stop buttons to manage - playback of media files
- easy background music playback, with automatic stop before the start of regularly scheduled meetings
- automatic external monitor recognition and management
- OBS Studio integration

As for fully **remote** congregation Zoom meetings, the inbuilt MP4 conversion feature in M³ enables you to share media files of all types easily, using Zoom's native MP4 sharing feature.

## Does M³ work in my language?

**Yes!** Media for meetings of Jehovah's Witnesses can be automatically downloaded in any of the hundreds of languages that are available on JW.org. The list of available languages is dynamically updated. All you need to do is select which one you want.

In addition, M³ itself has been translated, by many volunteers, into several languages! You can therefore configure the language you would like to be displayed in M³'s interface. Do you want to help translate M³ into your language? Check out our [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) file for instructions on how to do so.
