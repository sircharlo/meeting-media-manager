## What is this app?

**Meeting Media Manager**, or **M³** for short, is an app for Windows, macOS and Linux, that automatically downloads pictures and videos that will be considered during congregation meetings of Jehovah's Witnesses, in any language found on JW.org.

It features support for managing regular and custom meeting media, and support for multiple congregations and/or groups using the same computer account.

## What can M³ do?

In short, M³ allows you to easily and automatically download, synchronize, share and present all meeting media.

For **hybrid** or **in-person** congregation meetings, the integrated media presentation mode has all the features needed to simplify the task of sharing media with the congregation, including:

- Media thumbnails with the ability to zoom and pan, as well as set custom start and end times for media
- Easy-to-use pause/play/stop buttons to manage playback of media files
- Easy background music playback, with automatic stop before the start of regularly scheduled meetings
- Automatic external monitor recognition and management
- OBS Studio integration with automatic scene switching during media presentation
- Presenting JW.org website on an external monitor 
- Import JWPUB files, JWLPLAYLIST files, videos from JW.org, and media for public talks from the S-34 in a few clicks.
- Custom videos, pictures, audio files and even PDF files can be easily imported too! 

#### Give M³ a try today and see for yourself what it can do! Presenting media at congregation meetings has never been easier.

## Does M³ work in my language?

**Yes!** Media for meetings of Jehovah's Witnesses can be automatically downloaded in any of the hundreds of language that are available on JW.org. The list of available languages is dynamically updated; all you need to do is select which one you need.

In addition, M³ itself has been translated into several languages by many volunteers; you can therefore configure the language you would like to be displayed in M³'s interface.
