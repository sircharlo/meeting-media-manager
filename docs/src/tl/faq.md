### :earth_americas: Nakadepende ba ang app na ito sa mga panlabas na site, pinagkukunan, o "curators" upang mag-download ng mga publikasyon, media ng pulong, o ibang content? {#external-dependencies}

**Hindi.** Gumagana ito kagaya ng JW Library. Nagda-download ito ang mga publikasyon, media, at iba pang content nang direkta mula sa opisyal na website ng mga Saksi ni Jehova at ng kanilang content delivery network. Awtomatikong tinutukoy ng app kung ano ang kailangang i-download at kung ang mga patiunang na-download na content ay hindi na up-to-date at kailangang i-download muli.

:::info Note

## Troubleshooting {#troubleshooting}

### :warning: Media isn't downloading. What should I check? {#media-not-downloading}

Check these common issues:

2. **Language Settings**: Ensure your media language is set correctly
3. **Internet Connection**: Check your internet connection
4. **Language Availability**: Verify media is available in your selected language

<!-- 5. **Manual Refresh**: Try manually refreshing to check for new media -->

### :video_camera: The OBS integration isn't working. What should I verify? {#obs-not-working}

Check these OBS-related issues:

1. **OBS Installation**: Ensure OBS Studio is installed and running
2. **WebSocket Plugin**: Verify the WebSocket plugin is installed
3. **Port and Password**: Check your OBS port and password settings
4. **Firewall**: Ensure the firewall isn't blocking the connection

### :speaker: Does Meeting Media Manager automatically send the media audio to Zoom when using OBS Studio? {#audio-to-zoom}

**No.** M³ does not automatically send media audio to Zoom or OBS Studio. The video stream works like a virtual camera with no sound, just like a webcam. To have the music/video sound available in Zoom automatically, you need to ensure that Zoom 'hears' the audio feed coming from the computer, and then you should enable the **Original Audio** setting in Zoom.

**Important Notes:**

- You must enable Original Audio **every time** before starting a Zoom meeting
- This setting is not related to M³ - you would face the same audio issue when using any other media player and not using Zoom's screen and audio sharing features
- The Original Audio setting has three sub-options - typically the first two should be enabled and the third disabled for optimal audio quality
- If you're still experiencing audio issues, you may need to use Zoom's "Share Computer Sound" option instead
- Alternatively, look into using the Zoom integration instead, as it uses Zoom's native screen sharing.

**Why is this necessary?**
M³ plays media with sound on your computer, but this audio is not automatically transmitted through the video stream to Zoom when using OBS Studio. The Original Audio setting allows Zoom to capture the audio playing on your computer during screen sharing, if your computer is configured properly (for example: the computer has a second sound card that is used for media playback which Zoom listens to as a microphone.)

### :snail: M³ is running slowly. How can I improve performance? {#performance-issues}

Try these performance optimizations:

1. **Enable Extra Cache**: Turn on additional caching in settings
2. **Close Other Apps**: Close unnecessary applications
3. **Check Disk Space**: Ensure you have sufficient free disk space
4. **Reduce Resolution**: Lower the maximum resolution setting

### :speech_balloon: I'm having language issues. What should I check? {#language-issues}

Verify these language settings:

1. **Interface Language**: Check your display language setting
2. **Media Language**: Verify your media download language
3. **Language Availability**: Ensure the media language is available on the official website of Jehovah's Witnesses
4. **Fallback Language**: Try setting a fallback language
