## Does M³ work in my language? {#does-m3-work-in-my-language}

**Yes!** Media for meetings of Jehovah's Witnesses can be automatically downloaded in any of the hundreds of language that are available on the official website of Jehovah's Witnesses. The list of available languages is dynamically updated; all you need to do is select which one you need.

In addition, M³ itself has been translated into several languages by many volunteers; you can therefore configure the language you would like to be displayed in M³'s interface.
