# About Meeting Media Manager (M³)

## What is this app?

**Meeting Media Manager**, or **M³** for short, is an app for Windows, macOS and Linux, that automatically downloads pictures and videos that will be considered during congregation meetings of Jehovah's Witnesses, in any language found on JW.org.

It features support for managing custom and recurring media, an optional synchronization feature for members of the same congregation, as well as support for multiple congregations and/or groups using the same computer account.

::: info Note
M³ used to be known as JWMMF (JW Meeting Media Fetcher), but was renamed in May 2022.

## What can M³ do?

In short, M³ allows you to easily and automatically download, synchronize, share and present all meeting media.

For **hybrid** or **in-person** congregation meetings, the integrated media presentation mode has all the features needed to simplify the task of sharing media with the congregation, including:

- Media thumbnails
- Easy-to-use pause/play/stop buttons to manage playback of media files
- Easy background music playback, with automatic stop before the start of regularly scheduled meetings
- Automatic external monitor recognition and management
- OBS Studio integration

<!-- As for fully **remote** congregation Zoom meetings, the inbuilt MP4 conversion feature in M³ enables you to share media files of all types easily, using Zoom's native MP4 sharing feature. -->

Give M³ a try today and see for yourself what it can do! Presenting media at congregation meetings has never been easier.

## Does M³ work in my language?

**Yes!** Media for meetings of Jehovah's Witnesses can be automatically downloaded in any of the hundreds of language that are available on JW.org. The list of available languages is dynamically updated; all you need to do is select which one you need.

In addition, M³ itself has been translated into several languages by many volunteers; you can therefore configure the language you would like to be displayed in M³'s interface.
