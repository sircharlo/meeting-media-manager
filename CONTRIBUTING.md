## Help maintain this application

In order to help maintain this application, the following information will help you get started. If anything is unclear or you simply need more information, please feel free to make contact through [the discussion thread](https://github.com/sircharlo/meeting-media-manager/discussions).

### Developer Tools

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) >= v2.45.2
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) ^20 || ^22 || ^24
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) >= v4.5.0
- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) >= v1.94.2
  - VS Code extensions: see [extensions.json](./.vscode/extensions.json)

### Getting Started

To get started, you first have to install Git, Node.js and VS Code (see their respective documentation for more information). Once you have installed those, you can easily install Yarn by executing the following commands:

```bash
# Enable corepack feature of Node.js (includes yarn)
corepack enable

# Update yarn to the latest stable version
yarn set version stable
```

Once you have done that, you are ready to contribute! Fork this repository, clone it, and when you have something to contribute, you can create a Pull Request on GitHub.

### Build Setup

The following commands are used during the development of the application to test and build it:

```bash
# Install dependencies
yarn install

# Rebuild native modules
yarn rebuild

# Generate icon font
yarn icons

# Serve app with hot reload for development
yarn dev

# Build electron application for production
yarn build

# Lint all JS/TS/Vue files
yarn lint

# Run tests
yarn test
```

### Build Tools

This project is built with [Quasar](https://quasar.dev/). Documentation about the directory structure can be found [here](https://quasar.dev/quasar-cli-webpack/directory-structure).

This project uses [Electron.js](https://www.electronjs.org/) to create the desktop application. The Electron.js framework is a cross-platform framework for building native applications.

The UI process is made using [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/). Vue.js is framework for building web applications.

The UI components are made from [Quasar](https://quasar.dev/docs) components.

### Release Procedure

To release a new version of the application, you first create a draft release on GitHub. Then, you can change the [package.json](package.json) version to the desired version and commit the changes with the message `chore(release): vx.x.x` (e.g. `chore(release): v23.3.1`). Then, the build/release workflow will be executed and will fill the release draft with the new artifacts. After that, you can add a description of the release (features, bug fixes, etc.) and publish it.

If a release contains a critical bug fix, you can add `[critical]` to the release title. This will override the `Disable non-critical automatic app updates` setting and will force all users to update.

### Contribute to the documentation site

The documentation website lives in the `docs` folder. It is built with [VitePress](https://vitepress.dev/). Information about the directory structure can be found [here](https://vitepress.dev/guide/getting-started#file-structure). To work on the documentation site, you can use the following commands:

```bash
# Install dependencies
yarn install

# Serve website locally with hot reload for development
yarn docs:dev

# Build the website for production
yarn docs:build

# Preview the production build locally
yarn docs:preview

# Lint all JS/TS/Vue files
yarn lint
```
